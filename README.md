# Task Management App
Task Management App is a user-friendly web-based task management application that revolutionizes the way users organize their responsibilities. Users can create a personalized account, providing a secure login for seamless access to their tasks anytime, anywhere. The platform empowers users to efficiently manage their tasks through a straightforward interface, allowing for the effortless addition, deletion, and editing of tasks.

One distinctive feature of TaskEase is its dynamic task visualization. As tasks progress, users can easily track their status through three categories: "In Progress," "Completed," and "Future." The platform employs an intuitive color-coding system, with tasks changing to red after their due date has passed, providing a visual cue to prioritize and address overdue tasks promptly. This visual feedback ensures users stay organized and focused on their time-sensitive responsibilities, making TaskEase an indispensable tool for effective task management.
